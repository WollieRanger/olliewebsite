                            <h1>1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>
                            <p>For years I have wanted to be able to do work more efficiently. At the time of wanting to make improvements I did a lot of research into how I could achieve this. It led me down a rabbit hole of so many what ifs and could I’s. For starters, a better camera than the one I was using but at £2500 for the upgrade, would it take better pictures? Who knows but it was a massive upgrade, I quite clearly needed to save up. Then there is a new PC that would enable me to post process my work on, this is a must. It needed to be powerful and fast to tackle the large files sizes I was dealing with. Would it help me in the long run? Yes, but at over £2000 it was unachievable at the time. Roll on a few years where I am more financially secure. I have a very nice camera, a high end PC with a monthly subscription to Adobe. Have I got the right tools for the job? Yes. But at a finical cost that I will be paying off for a while.</p>
                            <P>Some questions I have rolling on in my head when writing this out, do I really need all this to make my life better? Could I have just gone on with what I had? The answer to both is yes. My life is better, my work has better workflow for completion and my camera takes great pictures. Yes, I could have not spent the money and spent it elsewhere. But it is my love and passion that I wanted to showcase.</P>
